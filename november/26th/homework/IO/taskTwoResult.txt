Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Another hero, another mindless crime
Hold the line
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
Outside the dawn is breaking
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
I can fly, my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show
I'll top the bill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
dad
